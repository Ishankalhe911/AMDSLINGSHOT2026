  "summary": "The diff implements most of the required features across frontend and backend. However, several specific acceptance criteria have gaps or are only partially implemented. The backend is missing conflict validation, hint retrieval, and answer-saving linked to sessions. Some frontend AC items like filtering challenges and the named modules from the spec are absent or renamed.",

      "requirement": "Dashboard must include module cards for all four specified modules: Architectural Logic, Data Structures, System Design, Git Mastery",
      "reason": "The Dashboard.tsx shows 'Data Structure Visualizer', 'Git Conflict Simulator', 'Industry Challenges', and 'AI Mentor Notes' — not the spec-named modules 'Architectural Logic' and 'System Design'. 'Architectural Logic' and 'Git Mastery' are missing by name.",
